Project Overview
In this project, we scraped book data from Books to Scrape, saved it into a CSV file, generated SQL insights, and performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python.

Steps Completed
Web Scraping: Extracted title, price, availability, and rating for each book.

SQL Insights: Loaded data into MySQL, answered questions about book stock, pricing, and ratings.

EDA and Visualization: Analyzed data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Created bar charts, histograms, and pie charts.
